        		    <h1>The story of Magical Potato</h1>
        			       <p> Magic Potato was born into a poor family at the base of the Rocky Mountains. The family who appeared as normal humans grew potato crops to make ends meet. So when a humanoid potato appeared, as you might expect, there was talk. If any of this bothered Magic Potato, he never let on. Apparently not realizing they might not be blood relations. As he grew older alongside his kin he began to present a series of abilities that a normal human might not have. He could grow eyes upon his body at will, take sustenance from sunlight alone, and was incredibly tough. He did have two weaknesses though. First he was susceptible to rot and sickness if he managed to catch something from the other potatoes and if left alone in the dark for too long he would begin to grow large roots which would hinder his movement, ruining his roughishly handsome good looks, at least for a time.
